== The Emu War

[quote, 'original article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War[wikipedia]']
--
The Emu War, also known as the Great Emu War, was a nuisance wildlife management military operation
undertaken in Australia over the later part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus
said to be destroying crops in the Campion district within the Wheatbelt of Western Australia.
The unsuccessful attempts to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia,
employed Royal Australian Artillery soldiers armed with Lewis guns—leading the media to adopt the name "Emu War"
when referring to the incident.
While a number of the birds were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction.

Kids nowadays just don't apreciate the sacrifices you make for their birthdays::
my daughter just screamed as I cut the goat's throat.
I've never been good at taking responsibility for my actions::
can't believe my parents raised me this way.
the worst addiction ever is being addicted to buying defective brakes::
you won't be able to stop.
